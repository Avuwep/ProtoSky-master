# ProtoSky-master (modified)
A modified version of Protosky that allows entities that generate in structures to generate instead of being deleted
Allowing entities to generate lets you obtain the following items:
Diamond,
Jukebox,
Diamond Block,
Enchanting Table,
Sponge,
Wet Sponge,
Glow Berries,
Enchanted Golden Apple.   
Based off of the ProtoSky mod by polarbub, DeadlyMC, Aqnox, CheaterCodes, MartMists-GH and asquared31415. https://github.com/DeadlyMC/ProtoSky        
Huge thanks to polarbub for helping me make these modifications.
